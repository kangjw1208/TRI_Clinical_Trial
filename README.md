# TRI Clinical Trial

## Overview
This project uses adverse event data from a drug clinical trial to determine the safely of the experiment. The drug is called Xanomeline which is discovered to be effective in treating severe mental disorder, namely Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. However, over 88 percent of the subjects reported some type of adverse event which raises the question of the drug's safety. The raw data was cleaned and engineered for most accurate result possible and in doing so, one patient was intentionally ommited out because one of the crucial data was missing for that subject. 

## Statistical Analysis
In the statistical analysis section, we first assigned a numerical values to each item in the severity and causality column. The reason is that we can use this numerical values to check for statistical significance in the difference of the mean between control and treatment groups. As seen from the p-value, every single test came out to be significant with an extremely small p-value.

## Conclusion
This clinical trial is not safe to continue until further research is performed to determine the exact pathophysiological effects of this drug to our various organ systems.
